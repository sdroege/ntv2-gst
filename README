This module contains code to build the AJA GStreamer pluggin.  Currently AJA
provides source elements for Uncompressed video (x-raw), HEVC/H.265 Compressed video (x-h265), 
and uncompressed PCM audio (x-raw S16LE, S32LE).

This code is provided under a LGPL license [1].

The elements need to link with static builds of ajabase and ajantv2.

Build ajabase and ajantv2:

    make -C ajalibraries/ajabase
    make -C ajalibraries/ajantv2

Build the gst plugin:

    cd ajaplugins/gstreamer/gst-plugin
    ./autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install
