There are classes in here that were in winclasses and I've been
copying them here in order to make the more cross platform.  The plan
is to move them into classes os ajaclasses when they're compatible and
then remove them from their respective win/lin homes.

"C" means they compile
"W" means they compile and work
 
So far, these are here:

C   ntv2active.cpp
C 	ntv2active.h
C 	ntv2dpx.cpp
C 	ntv2dpx.h
C 	ntv2outputaudio.cpp
C 	ntv2outputaudio.h
C 	ntv2thread.h
C 	ntv2xenacircularbuffer.cpp
C 	ntv2xenacircularbuffer.h
C	performancecounter.cpp
C	performancecounter.h
